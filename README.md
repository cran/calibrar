## Overview

This package allows the parameter estimation (i.e.Â calibration) of
complex models, including stochastic ones. It implements generic
functions that can be used for fitting any type of models, especially
those with non-differentiable objective functions, with the same syntax
as base::optim. It supports multiple phases estimation (sequential
parameter masking), constrained optimization (bounding box restrictions)
and automatic parallel computation of numerical gradients. Some common
maximum likelihood estimation methods and automated construction of the
objective function from simulated model outputs is provided.  
See <https://roliveros-ramos.github.io/calibrar/> for more details.

## Installation

``` r
# The easiest way to get calibrar is to install it from CRAN:
install.packages("calibrar")

# Alternatively, install the stable development version from OSMOSE drat repository:
install.packages("calibrar", repo="https://osmose-model.github.io/drat/")

# Or the development version from GitHub:
# install.packages("pak")
remotes::install_github("roliveros-ramos/calibrar")
```

## Usage

For a quick introduction, check the worked the examples available from
the package:

``` r
library(calibrar)
vignette("calibrar")
```

For a more detailed explanation of the package philosophy, you can read
the pre-print [calibrar: an R package for fitting complex ecological
models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.03141).
